## Current Project: Console Game Hub

This project is a collaborative software development platform designed for undergraduate CS students, featuring a console-based arcade of classic and logic-driven games.

It is intended to help students practice software development principles (such as, agile development, test-driven development, object-oriented design, pair-programming, and refactoring) through fun and meaningful work.

The goal is to reinforce core and agile software development concepts and practices by contributing in an engaging, real-world context.
