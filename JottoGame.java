/**
 * A logic-based word guessing game where the player must deduce a secret
 *  5-letter word.
 * <pre>
 * In Jotto, after each guess, the player is told how many letters
 *   in their guess match the secret word, regardless of position.
 * For example, if the secret word is "BRICK" and the player guesses
 *   "CRANE", the feedback would be "2 letters match"
 *   (because of the R and C).
 * 
 * Scoring Recommendation:
 * - You may give the player a fixed number of guesses (e.g., 10).
 * - A score could be calculated as (guesses remaining) or
 *     (max guesses - actual guesses used).
 * - You could also assign a bonus if they guess the word early or
 *     penalize for inefficient guessing.
 * 
 * Feedback Advice:
 * - Ensure the feedback count does not double-count repeated letters.
 *   For example, if the secret word has only one 'C' and the guess has two
 *     count only one.
 *
 * Implementation Tips:
 * - Keep a set or multiset of letters in the secret word to track
 *     matches efficiently.
 * - Validate user input to be 5 letters and alphabetic only.
 * - Use consistent casing (e.g., convert all to uppercase).
 * - Use Optional<Integer> for scoring to integrate with the game
 *     history tracker.
